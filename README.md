AutoTodo is a simple yet powerful extension that automatically generates a todo.txt file in the root directory whenever you open a new project.

Why I Created AutoTodo?
As developers, we often start new projects without a clear plan for tasks, bug fixes, or features to implement. I built AutoTodo to solve this problem by ensuring that every project starts with a structured to-do list right from the beginning. 

## Features

Creates todo.txt file automatically on opening any folder for first time in the vs code.

✅ Keeping track of tasks without external tools
✅ Maintaining a habit of organizing work from the start
✅ Reducing clutter by storing notes directly within the project

How It Works?

When you open a new folder in VS Code, AutoTodo automatically creates a todo.txt file in the root directory.
You can instantly start adding tasks, reminders, or notes.
No manual setup required—just open and start working!

Perfect for developers, students, and project managers who want a lightweight and effective way to manage tasks.
